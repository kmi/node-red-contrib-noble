    <p>This node allows scanning for BLE devices, restricted if necessary by the services they offer.</p>
    <p>This node will generate one message per BLE device detected according to the node configuration.</p>
    <p>The node will also generate events according to the status of the bluetooth interface when it changes. Those status messages include:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Whether there was an <b>msg.error</b></li>
        <li>Whether there was a <b>msg.stateChange</b></li>
        <li>The current <b>msg.state</b> of the interface</li>
        <li>The <b>msg.payload</b> will be empty in this case to prevent mistreating status messages as BLE detection messages.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The node will begin scanning after its deployed, and will not stop until it is deployed again.  It can be useful to turn on and off scanning to conserve energy and force scan requests to be sent triggering devices to respond.  To control scanning, send a message containing <code>msg.scan=false</code> to turn off scanning, and <code>msg.scan=true</code> to turn it on.</p>

    <p>The <b>msg.payload</b> will contain the <i>peripheral uuid</i> and the <i>local name</i> of the BLE device detected.</p>
    <p>Additionally it will set the following values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sets the <b>msg.peripheralUuid</b> to the <i>peripheral uuid</i> of the BLE device detected.</li>
        <li>Sets the <b>msg.rssi</b> to the <i>received signal strength indicator (RSSI)</i> of the BLE device detected.</li>
        <li>Sets <b>msg.localName</b> to the name of the device if any.</li>
        <li>Sets <b>msg.detectedAt</b> to the moment the device was detected on milliseconds since 1 Jan 1970.</li>
        <li>Sets <b>msg.detectedBy</b> to the name of the machine that detected the BLE device.</li>
        <li>Sets <b>msg.advertisement</b> to the full advertisement of the BLE device (see Noble documentation).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the device follows the iBeacon specification, the message will also contain the following properties</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sets the <b>msg.manufacturerUuid</b> to the <i>uuid</i> of the manufacturer of the BLE device detected.</li>
        <li>Sets the <b>msg.major</b> to the <i>major number</i> of the manufacturer of the BLE device detected.</li>
        <li>Sets the <b>msg.minor</b> to the <i>minor number</i> of the manufacturer of the BLE device detected.</li>
        <li>Sets the <b>msg.measuredPower</b> to the <i>measured power at one meter</i> of the BLE device detected.</li>
        <li>Sets the <b>msg.accuracy</b> to the <i>accuracy</i> estimated for this measurement.</li>
        <li>Sets the <b>msg.proximity</b> to the <i>proximity</i> guessed for this device. The value will be one of: 'unknown', 'immediate', 'near', 'far' </li>
    </ul>
